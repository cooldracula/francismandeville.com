      <h1>A migrant’s tale</h1><p>“No More Deaths!”<br/>That’s the NGO’s goal,<br/>but mine was hiking just one more mile,<br/>trekking east into the blistering Sonoyta Valley,<br/>an unbelievable wash basin in the Sonora Desert.<br/>Here sand and stone meets Oregon Pipe Cactus,<br/>its long arms ascend skyward<br/>pleading no more sun, no more deaths.<br/>A spectral system of streams fan out<br/>in fractured, thirsty veins until vanishing in the heat,<br/>leaving sand and stunted scrub until sight surrenders to haze.<br/>Four gallons of water gouge into my back,<br/>another person carries similar freight.<br/>We trudged three miles off the highway<br/>to find ICE slashed our old water jugs and<br/>mangled our bicycle flag marking the spot.<br/>Eastward we headed to find a new location<br/>and the odometer said we were nearly there;<br/>when we found a white bundle of fleece,<br/>laid underneath a bush which, when unwrapped,<br/>was a tiny baby girl with sunken eyes<br/>never to see the end of the journey<br/>she and her mom begun.<br/>Dried stains of hardship, a story of thirst etched in brown,<br/>a tiny life abruptly ended when her mother,<br/>the weight of her curled body indented in the sand,<br/>could no longer nurse her.</p><p>A mother who walked thousands of miles left her here,<br/>and a volunteer drove over a thousand miles to find her here;<br/>we both ended up on our knees, sobbing in the desert here,<br/>dropping tears that never dented the hot desert floor.<br/>We learned long ago not to call 911 - nobody ever comes.<br/>We bundled the baby back into her blanket and slipped her,<br/>while blubbering a prayer, into a black garbage bag;<br/>untangled the bicycle flag and zip-tied it to a bush<br/>by the water jugs and then, in reverent silence,<br/>slipped the baby into the backpack.<br/>Our trek back was taut with strained emotions,<br/>sobs subsided, a silent pack made as the harsh sun<br/>beat down our heavy hearts. We took turns<br/>carrying our little treasure to our truck parked<br/>outside the Town of Why.</p>
