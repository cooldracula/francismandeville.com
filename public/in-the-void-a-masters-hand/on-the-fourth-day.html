      <h1>On the Fourth Day</h1><p>Maybelle, my queen goat, a slumbering mound,<br/>curled, serene, so soft and round,<br/>an inviting pillow for my weary head.<br/>She won’t notice me if, instead<br/>of sitting down on this sack,<br/>I lay my head on her back;</p><p>But, she did! Her yellow dragon eyes<br/>snap open, vertical slits, my demise<br/>reflected in their portrait vision,<br/>suddenly jumps up leaving no delusion<br/>that I am not suppose to do that!<br/>She marches off, calling me a brat</p><p>And strikes a regal pose,<br/>staring down her long nose,<br/>chewing deliciously on hay.<br/>Then it struck me, she’s can’t stray<br/>into a world of what-if,<br/>no imagining a different way.</p><p>No thoughts of what could be<br/>ever enter her noble head,<br/>her mind can’t drift or shift<br/>into anything but present tense;<br/>but much worse, she can’t see<br/>a ‘you and me’ beyond feed.</p><p>If I am a god to her, then why do i feel hurt?<br/>How about a heartfelt thank you?<br/>or how about creating your own feed,<br/>or let me watch you meet your own needs?<br/>Why must I always take the lead?<br/>And then, as if struck my lightning,<br/>my mind shifts to more celestial things;<br/>thinking about how God felt<br/>with the creations he dealt<br/>who couldn’t even see Him<br/>and the loneliness he beared.</p><p>I imagined, even more, the thrill<br/>when He saw, for the first time,<br/>a sun drawn on a cave wall<br/>with stick figures, arms<br/>raised high; surely bringing<br/>tears to his eyes,<br/>realizing they see Me! Alas<br/>finally someone who can–<br/>Come back to me.</p>
